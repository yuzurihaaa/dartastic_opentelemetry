# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic
Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

<!-- Conventions.

     Headings are the six Keep a Changelog sections only: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security. There is
     no "Breaking Changes" heading and no "Fixed (spec compliance)" heading.

     A breaking change goes under Changed or Removed, with the bullet prefixed "**BREAKING**: ".

     A fix that came out of the OpenTelemetry specification compliance audit goes under Fixed and names the spec document
     and requirement level in the entry itself, for example "which trace/api.md makes a MUST". That citation is what
     records the provenance now that the heading is gone, so do not drop it. The audit findings are tracked under the
     spec-compliance label.

## [1.1.0-beta.16-wip]

### Fixed

- The `dartastic_opentelemetry_api` dependency is pinned to the current rc (`>=1.0.0-rc.3 <1.0.0-rc.4`) so a new API
  prerelease cannot break a fresh `pub get`. Widen it only after the SDK is adapted
  ([#297](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/297)).
- A synchronous `UpDownCounter` is now exported as a non-monotonic sum, which metrics/sdk.md makes a MUST for Sum
  aggregation. Before, OTLP exported it with `is_monotonic: true`. `Counter` now sets `isMonotonic: true` explicitly
  ([#307](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/307)).
- The Prometheus exporter now types a non-monotonic sum as `gauge`, not `counter`, which
  compatibility/prometheus_and_openmetrics.md makes a MUST
  ([#307](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/307)).

## [1.1.0-beta.15] - 2026-08-28

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: `enabled` becomes `isEnabled()` on tracers, loggers, meters and instruments, following the same change
  in the API ([api#105](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/105)). Replace
  `x.enabled` with `x.isEnabled()`. `Tracer.isEnabled()` accepts `kind` and `context`, and `OTelLogger.isEnabled()`
  accepts `context`, `severityNumber` and `eventName`. The `enabled` getters on `TracerProvider`, `MeterProvider` and
  `LoggerProvider` are unchanged: those are provider lifecycle state, not the per-call check. Requires
  `dartastic_opentelemetry_api` 1.0.0-rc.3.
- **BREAKING**: `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` values are always strings
  ([#206](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/issues/206)). They were previously coerced to
  `int` or `bool` where they looked numeric, which changed the type of those attributes on the wire.
- **BREAKING**: `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` values are percent-decoded, so `k=a%2Cb` now yields `a,b`.
- **BREAKING**: `Exemplar.fromMeasurement` signature reverted to take a `Measurement` object instead of spreading its
  fields. This restores the previous API shape and adheres to the DRY principle.

### Added

- **`ExemplarFilter` and `ExemplarReservoir` are exported.** `OTel.initialize` accepts an `exemplarFilter` and
  `MeterProvider.exemplarFilter` is public, but the types themselves were not exported, so neither could be used from
  application code.
- **Attribute limit environment variables are parsed**
  ([#74](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/74)): `OTEL_ATTRIBUTE_COUNT_LIMIT`,
  `OTEL_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE_LENGTH_LIMIT` and the `OTEL_LOGRECORD_*` variants, with the spec's signal-specific-then-general
  fallback. Enforcing the limits is follow-up work, so setting them has no effect on emitted telemetry yet.

- **Metrics SDK Exemplars implementation**
  ([#277](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/277)): Implemented `ExemplarFilter` and
  `ExemplarReservoir` as required by the OpenTelemetry Specification. The metrics SDK now collects exemplars for sum,
  gauge, and histogram instruments according to the configured exemplar filter.

### Fixed

- **The `secure` parameter now works for logs and metrics**
  ([#269](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/269),
  [#225](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/issues/225)). Previously `secure` overrode the
  gRPC endpoint scheme; now the scheme (`http:`, `https:`) takes precedence and `secure` applies only to scheme-less
  endpoints.
- **`OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` is honored when `detectPlatformResources` is `false`**, and a malformed value is dropped
  with a warning instead of failing `OTel.initialize`.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-08-28

Stable-channel republication of `1.1.0-beta.15`. Depends on `dartastic_opentelemetry_api: ^0.11.0`.

The minor bump from `0.10.0` carries four **breaking** changes:

- **`enabled` becomes `isEnabled()`** on tracers, loggers, meters and instruments, following the API. Replace
  `x.enabled` with `x.isEnabled()`. The `enabled` getters on the three providers are unchanged.
- **`OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` values are always strings**
  ([#206](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/issues/206)), no longer coerced to `int` or
  `bool` where they looked numeric, which changed their type on the wire.
- **`OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` values are percent-decoded**, so `k=a%2Cb` now yields `a,b`.
- **`Exemplar.fromMeasurement` takes a `Measurement` again** rather than its spread fields.

Also notable: exemplars are sampled through an `ExemplarFilter` and `ExemplarReservoir` per the metrics spec
([#154](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/277)), attribute limit environment variables
are parsed ([#73](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/74)), the `secure` parameter is
honored for logs and metrics ([#253](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/269)), and
`OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` is read even when `detectPlatformResources` is `false`.

## [1.1.0-beta.14] - 2026-08-23

### Changed
- **Requires `dartastic_opentelemetry_api` ^1.0.0-rc.2.** Picks up the semantic conventions at registry v1.44.0,
  including the full `browser.web_vital.*` set, and three spec-compliance fixes.

  One of those changes behaviour visible from this package: `Context.withSpanContext` now returns a derived Context when
  the incoming span context belongs to a different trace, instead of throwing `ArgumentError`. Per the Context
  specification a set-value operation always returns a derived Context, and per the Propagators API `extract` must never
  throw, receiving a valid span context for another trace during extraction is ordinary, not an error. Four tests that
  asserted the throw now assert the derived Context.

  `SDKSpan.end()` no longer forwards the deprecated `spanStatus` argument to its delegate; `setStatus()` had already
  applied it to the same delegate, so the second pass was redundant.


- **BREAKING (spec compliance): sampler decisions are now honored end to end**
  ([#260](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/260)). A `Drop` decision produces a
  non-recording span that reaches no processor; `RecordOnly` records without setting the W3C `Sampled` flag; built-in
  processors deliver only recording spans to `onStart`/`onEnd` and only sampled spans to exporters, per the spec's
  IsRecording/Sampled reaction table; the forbidden Sampled+non-recording combination is unrepresentable; `createSpan`
  routes through the sampler and processors instead of bypassing them. Code that relied on unsampled or dropped spans
  being exported must adjust its sampler configuration.

- **BREAKING (spec compliance): the default sampler is now `ParentBased(root: AlwaysOn)`** instead of bare `AlwaysOn`
  ([#260](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/260)). Root spans still sample by default,
  but child spans of unsampled remote or local parents now respect the parent's decision. Pass `sampler: const
  AlwaysOnSampler()` to restore the old behavior.

- **Child spans inherit the parent `TraceState`**
  ([#260](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/260)), and **`SamplingResult` gains a
  `traceState` field** ([#260](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/260)) so samplers can
  modify or replace it: `null` keeps the inherited parent TraceState, an explicitly empty `TraceState` clears it.
  Existing custom samplers keep working unchanged.

- **BREAKING**: `OTelEnv` configuration functions (`getOtlpConfig`, `getBspConfig`, `getServiceConfig`,
  `getLogRecordLimits`, etc.) now return strongly-typed Dart Records instead of `Map<String, dynamic>`. Migration hint:
  Update map accesses to record property accesses (e.g., `config['endpoint'] as String?` → `config.endpoint`).

### Added

- `TracerProvider.hasSpanProcessors`, allocation-free check for registered span processors.

- **OTLP exporters send an identifying `User-Agent` header.** Per the OTLP spec, OTLP requests SHOULD identify the
  exporter, language, and version. Every OTLP request now carries `OTel-OTLP-Exporter-Dart/<version>` (HTTP headers on
  the HTTP exporters; `ChannelOptions.userAgent` on the gRPC exporters). A user-supplied `user-agent` header is
  prepended to the default rather than replacing it
  ([#228](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/issues/228)).

- **`OTel.defaultGrpcEndpoint`** (`http://localhost:4317`), the OTLP/gRPC default endpoint. The endpoint default is now
  picked per signal after the protocol is resolved instead of defaulting everything to the HTTP port 4318
  ([#220](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/issues/220)).

### Fixed

- **`browser.*` resource attributes and `user_agent.original` are now populated on web**
  ([#259](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/259)). Invalid `@JS` bindings made the web
  resource detector throw on first use; the error was swallowed and the attributes were silently missing. A detector
  failure now omits attributes instead of emitting blanks.

- **`browser.mobile` is now a boolean**, which is how the registry types it. It was emitted as the string
  `'true'`/`'false'`, so a backend filtering `browser.mobile = true` matched nothing.

- **`browser.languages` is now a string array, and its key comes from the API.** It was a comma-joined string under a
  key this package declared privately. The naming rules say an attribute that can represent multiple entities "SHOULD be
  pluralized and the value type SHOULD be an array", which is also how the registry shapes the neighbouring
  `browser.brands`. The key is now `BrowserCandidate.browserLanguages`, staged in the API as an upstream candidate, so
  the name and the argument for it live in one place. It is set only when the browser reports languages: an empty array
  is a real value on the wire and would claim the browser accepts none.

- **`browser.vendor` is no longer emitted.** `navigator.vendor` is a frozen legacy API that returns a hardcoded vendor
  string rather than the real vendor, and the registry's `browser.brands` is the structured answer to the same question.

- **`browser.mobile` is now correct on iPad.** Since iPadOS 13 an iPad requests desktop sites by default and reports a
  `Macintosh` user agent, so a user-agent test alone reported every iPad as a desktop. The detector now also consults
  `navigator.maxTouchPoints`, which distinguishes a touch device from a Mac. A touchscreen laptop is still not mobile.
  Both signals have to agree.

- **`OtlpHttpMetricExporter.forceFlush()` and `shutdown()` now await in-flight exports**
  ([#263](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/263)). Both returned immediately, and
  `shutdown()` closed the HTTP client under the live request. Failing an export that was about to succeed. Now matches
  the span and log HTTP exporters.

- `Tracer.enabled` now returns `false` when `TracerProvider` has no span processor(s) registered, per the Trace SDK
  spec, sparing span-creation cost when nothing is listening. Thanks to @abidiahmedcom
  ([#175](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/175)).

- **OTLP/gRPC exporters now default to port 4317, not 4318.** The OTLP spec defaults the endpoint to
  `http://localhost:4317` for OTLP/gRPC and `http://localhost:4318` for the two HTTP protocols. Previously a single 4318
  default was applied before the protocol was known, so gRPC-only deployments silently exported to the wrong port
  ([#220](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/issues/220)).

- **An empty environment variable value is treated as unset.** Per the spec, an empty value of an environment variable
  MUST be interpreted the same way as when the variable is unset. `EnvironmentService.getValue` now normalizes empty
  strings to `null`, so every consumer (endpoint, protocol, service name, log level, …) reads an empty value as unset
  ([#238](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/238)).

  Thanks to @abidiahmedcom; reported by @yuzurihaaa
  ([#238](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/238),
  [#220](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/issues/220),
  [#228](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/issues/228)).

- **`service.name` in `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` no longer overrides an explicit `serviceName:` argument or
  `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`** ([#104](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/104)). Precedence is
  now, highest first: explicit argument, `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`, `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`, default. `service.version`
  follows the same order.

- `OTEL_LOG_LEVEL` now takes effect at the start of `OTel.initialize`, so debug logging covers the environment parsing
  itself.

- **Baggage values containing `=` (e.g. base64 padding) are no longer dropped** on extract, and an unparsable `baggage`
  header leaves existing baggage untouched instead of clearing it. Thanks to @abidiahmedcom
  ([#261](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/261)).

## [0.10.0] - 2026-08-23
Stable-channel republication of `1.1.0-beta.14`. Depends on `dartastic_opentelemetry_api: ^0.10.0`.

The minor bump from `0.9.8` carries three **breaking** spec-compliance changes:

- **Sampler decisions are honored end to end**
  ([#260](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/260)): dropped spans reach no processor,
  `RecordOnly` no longer sets the W3C `Sampled` flag, and exporters receive only sampled spans. Adjust your sampler
  configuration if you relied on unsampled spans being exported.
- **The default sampler is `ParentBased(root: AlwaysOn)`**
  ([#260](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/260)): child spans now respect an unsampled
  parent. Pass `sampler: const AlwaysOnSampler()` to restore the old behavior.
- **`OTelEnv` configuration functions return typed Dart Records** instead of `Map<String, dynamic>` (`config['endpoint']
  as String?` → `config.endpoint`).

Also notable: OTLP/gRPC exporters default to port 4317 per the OTLP spec
([#220](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/issues/220)), OTLP requests carry an identifying
`User-Agent` ([#228](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/issues/228)), empty environment
variables read as unset ([#238](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/238)), `service.name`
precedence is fixed ([#104](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/104)), `browser.*`
resource attributes are populated on web
([#259](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/259)) with `browser.mobile` as a boolean, and
baggage values containing `=` survive extraction
([#261](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/261)). Full detail in the `1.1.0-beta.14`
entry.

- **BREAKING: W3C Baggage now percent-encodes per the W3C grammar instead of form-style encoding**
  ([#264](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/264),
  [#197](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/issues/197)). Values encode every byte outside
  the W3C `baggage-octet` allowlist (`%` → `%25`, space → `%20`, `,`/`;`/`"`/`\`/`:` escaped, controls and non-ASCII
  UTF-8 percent-encoded) instead of sending space as `+`; keys travel as raw RFC 7230 tokens, and keys that are not
  valid tokens are dropped on inject and ignored on extract; metadata is encoded too, so it can no longer forge
  additional header entries; extract ignores unparsable list members instead of throwing into the caller (which also
  blocked `traceparent` parsing). Migration hint: the previous release decoded `+` as space. During a rolling deploy
  against it, entries with spaces or `+` in values (e.g. `key+with+spaces`) can be lost or misread at the version
  boundary; use token keys and expect literal `+` in values on mixed fleets.

## [1.1.0-beta.13] - 2026-08-13

### Security

- **OTLP header values are no longer written to the debug log.** Two leaks are fixed:
  - Debug logging logged the raw values of all `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` and the signal-specific
    `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_{TRACES,METRICS,LOGS}_HEADERS`. The message was emitted above the per-header loop that redacts
    `Authorization`, so the credential reached the log regardless of that redaction. Thanks to @arpitjain099
    ([#100](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/100)).
  - `OtlpHttpSpanExporter` and `OtlpHttpLogRecordExporter` printed every header value except `Authorization`, at
    construction and on each export request, including headers configured in code, which never pass through an
    environment variable.

  **Who is affected:** applications running with `OTEL_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` (or `OTelLog` at debug) and a credential in an
  OTLP header, from the environment or from exporter config. Treat any debug logs collected from an affected build as
  containing that credential and rotate it.

  Tracked as
  [GHSA-4rh6-c2v5-374w](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/security/advisories/GHSA-4rh6-c2v5-374w)
  (CWE-532). Affects `>= 1.0.0-alpha` on this line and `>= 0.9.0` on the stable channel; see the 0.9.8 entry.

### Added

- **`OTEL_DART_HEADER_LOG_ALLOWLIST`**, and `OTel.initialize(otlpHeaderLogAllowlist:)`, name the OTLP headers whose
  values may appear in the debug log ([#101](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/101)).
  Names match exactly, case insensitively; the code parameter replaces the environment variable rather than adding to
  it; `authorization` and `proxy-authorization` are never logged even when listed. Thanks to @arpitjain099
  ([#101](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/101)).

### Changed

- Debug logs now print `name: [REDACTED]` for any header value not on the allowlist, replacing `Authorization: [REDACTED -
  length: N]`. The length is dropped on purpose, since it narrows the search space for the token. Header names and the
  header count are still logged. A header value you relied on seeing at debug level now has to be listed in
  `OTEL_DART_HEADER_LOG_ALLOWLIST`.

### Added
- **Metrics environment configuration support**. The SDK now supports configuring the metrics export interval, export
  timeout, and exemplar filter via standard OpenTelemetry environment variables:
  - `OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL`: Sets the export interval (default: 60000 ms).
  - `OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_TIMEOUT`: Sets the export timeout (default: 30000 ms).
  - `OTEL_METRICS_EXEMPLAR_FILTER`: Configures the exemplar filtering policy (`always_on`, `always_off`, or
    `trace_based`). Note: This is groundwork ahead of
    [#154](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/issues/154); filtering is currently inactive as
    the SDK does not yet record exemplars.

### Changed
- **Default metric export interval changed to 60s.** The `PeriodicExportingMetricReader` default export interval has
  been updated from the previous hardcoded `15s` to the spec-compliant `60s`. To restore the old cadence, set
  `OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL=15000` in your environment.

## [1.1.0-beta.12] - 2026-07-20

### Changed
- **Internal attribute keys now come from the generated registry enums** (`Service.*`, `ExceptionAttributes.*`,
  `Otel.*`) instead of string literals, across resource creation, exception recording, the `package:logging` bridge, the
  OTLP span/log transformers, the sampler, and the env resource-attribute parsing. A mistyped key is now a compile
  error, the same hardening applied to the resource detector after
  [#90](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/issues/90). No wire change: `Enum.key` resolves to
  the identical registry string.
  
### Fixed
- **`host.arch` no longer reports the hostname**
  ([#91](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/91)). The IO resource detector copy-pasted
  `Platform.localHostname` into `host.arch`; it now resolves the real CPU architecture (`amd64`/`arm64`/`arm32`/`x86`/…)
  from `Platform.version`, mapped to registry values, and omits the attribute when it can't be parsed. Fixes downstream
  consumers that select per-architecture artifacts (e.g. debug symbols) off the resource.
- The IO detector now keys every attribute from the generated registry enums (`Host.*`, `Os.*`, `ProcessAttributes.*`)
  instead of string literals, so a mistyped key is a compile error, the class of bug that caused
  [#90](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/issues/90). The malformed `host.os.name` is
  corrected to `os.name`.

### Removed
- The IO resource detector no longer emits `host.processors`, `host.locale`, or `process.num_threads`. None are
  OpenTelemetry registry attributes.

## [1.1.0-beta.11] - 2026-07-20
### Changed
- Doc only, README.md platform updates and clarity.

## [1.1.0-beta.10] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed
- **`W3CBaggagePropagator.extract` no longer discards the incoming context when the `baggage` header is absent**
  ([#89](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/89)). It returned a fresh context instead of
  the passed one, so in the spec-default composite (tracecontext, then baggage) any request carrying `traceparent` but
  no `baggage` header lost its just-extracted span context, breaking traces at every service boundary unless callers
  hand-ordered extraction. Per the Propagators API spec, extract now returns the passed context unchanged when there is
  nothing to extract.
- **OTLP endpoint schemes now determine TLS per the OTLP spec**
  ([#89](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/89)). `http://` endpoints connect insecure
  and `https://` secure; `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE` (and per-signal variants) applies only to scheme-less endpoints,
  and an explicit programmatic `secure` still wins. Previously `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://collector:4317`
  attempted TLS and failed with a HandshakeException unless the insecure flag was also set. Resolution is shared across
  all three signals via `OTelEnv.resolveOtlpSecure`; metrics additionally now honor
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_INSECURE`, which was parsed but ignored.

### Fixed
- **OTLP/JSON enum fields are now encoded as integers per the OTLP spec**, not proto3-JSON's default enum names: span
  `kind`, status `code`, log `severityNumber`, metric `aggregationTemporality`. Same origin story as the 1.1.0-beta.7
  hex-id fix, `toProto3Json()`'s defaults deviate from the OTLP spec, lenient receivers masked it, and a strict
  cross-implementation check (the Dartastic engine wire-parity harness) caught it. Conversion is field-keyed and
  prefix-guarded, so attribute string values that merely resemble enum names are never touched.

### Added
- **Public `MetricTransformer.transformMetrics` one-shot**, the metrics analogue of
  `OtlpLogRecordTransformer.transformLogRecords`: converts a whole `MetricData` batch to a ready-to-serialize OTLP
  `ExportMetricsServiceRequest` (`transformMetrics(data).writeToBuffer()`), so alternative exporters and sinks can reuse
  the transform instead of re-implementing the per-metric mapping. Both bundled OTLP metric exporters (HTTP and gRPC)
  now build their requests through it, removing two hand-rolled copies of the same assembly; wire output is unchanged
  (same instrumentation-scope constant, same `OTel.resource(null)` fallback, resolved by the caller so the transformer
  stays a pure leaf).

### Changed
- **OTEL_BLRP_* env var validation now warns on invalid values**, previously, invalid `OTEL_BLRP_SCHEDULE_DELAY` and
  `OTEL_BLRP_EXPORT_TIMEOUT` values were silently ignored; they now emit `OTelLog.warn` diagnostics consistent with BSP
  behavior. `OTEL_BLRP_SCHEDULE_DELAY=0` is now accepted as valid (meaning "export as fast as possible"), and
  `OTEL_BLRP_EXPORT_TIMEOUT=0` means "no limit", mirroring BSP semantics.
- **`OTelEnv._getPositiveIntEnv` now warns on unusable values**, non-numeric, below-minimum, and above-maximum values
  all emit `OTelLog.warn`, giving consistent diagnostics to every caller without per-site bookkeeping.
- **`OTelEnv.getBlrpConfig()` simplified to raw env reading**, domain-level defaults, validation, and batch-to-queue
  clamping moved to `BatchLogRecordProcessorConfig.fromEnvironment()`.

## [1.1.0-beta.9] - 2026-07-18

### Changed
- Adopt `dartastic_opentelemetry_api` 1.0.0-rc.1 (constraint `^1.0.0-rc.1`). No SDK code changes were needed: the SDK
  never used the removed vendor/RUM enums, and it implements the now-abstract `APIObservableResult` interface.
- CI: self-hosted coverage badge built from lcov.info and published to the `badges` branch; Codecov upload removed
  (uploads had failed since branch protection was enabled). The README coverage badge is now live data instead of a
  hardcoded percentage.

## [1.1.0-beta.8] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- **`OTEL_PROPAGATORS` support and global propagator wiring.** `OTel.initialize()` now installs the API's global
  `TextMapPropagator` per the spec ("Global Propagators"): the default is the W3C `tracecontext,baggage` composite;
  `none` (or no supported values) leaves the API's spec-mandated no-op in place; unsupported names emit an
  `OTelLog.warn` and are ignored. Supported values: `tracecontext`, `baggage`, `none`. Instrumentation libraries can now
  obtain "the" propagator via `OTelAPI.textMapPropagator` instead of being handed one explicitly.
- **`OTEL_BSP_*` environment variables** for configuring `BatchSpanProcessor` (`OTEL_BSP_SCHEDULE_DELAY`,
  `OTEL_BSP_EXPORT_TIMEOUT`, `OTEL_BSP_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE`, `OTEL_BSP_MAX_EXPORT_BATCH_SIZE`). Values are read by
  `BatchSpanProcessorConfig.fromEnvironment()` which `OTel.initialize()` uses by default. Invalid or out-of-range values
  now emit `OTelLog.warn` diagnostics. `OTEL_BSP_EXPORT_TIMEOUT=0` is honored as "no limit" per spec.
- **Comma-separated `OTEL_*_EXPORTER` lists.** The spec's "implementation MAY accept a comma-separated list to enable
  setting multiple exporters" is now supported for all three signals: `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=otlp,console` installs a
  `CompositeExporter`, metrics use a `CompositeMetricExporter`, and logs install one processor per exporter. `none` in a
  list wins; unsupported values (`zipkin`, the deprecated `logging`) emit an `OTelLog.warn` and are ignored; a list with
  no usable values falls back to the spec default `otlp`. Previously a list value silently installed no exporter at all.
- Unknown `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER` values now warn and are ignored instead of silently becoming `otlp`; `prometheus` gets
  a dedicated warning pointing at programmatic `PrometheusExporter` use and the planned scrape server
  ([#82](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/issues/82)). Auto-wiring it today would be a
  silent no-op since the env-created exporter is unreachable by the app.

### Removed

- **Breaking: `OTel.initialize` no longer accepts `dartasticApiKey` or `tenantId`, and the `OTel.dartasticApiKey` static
  is gone.** Both were non-standard, vendor-specific parameters that predate the platform layering: API keys belong in
  OTLP exporter headers (`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`) and tenant identity is platform-layer context, not an SDK
  concern. The `tenant_id` resource-attribute stamping and its debug-log special-casing are removed with them.
- **Breaking: the non-standard `OTEL_*`-namespace extensions are renamed or removed.** The per-signal diagnostic vars
  squatted the spec's core namespace and are renamed to the spec's language-specific convention
  (`OTEL_{LANGUAGE}_{FEATURE}`): `OTEL_LOG_SPANS` → `OTEL_DART_LOG_SPANS`, `OTEL_LOG_METRICS` → `OTEL_DART_LOG_METRICS`,
  `OTEL_LOG_EXPORT` → `OTEL_DART_LOG_EXPORT` (same semantics: enable the `OTelLog` per-signal diagnostic sinks;
  programmatic setters unchanged). The `OTEL_CONSOLE_EXPORTER` dart-define is removed. Console output of the telemetry
  itself uses the standard `OTEL_*_EXPORTER=console` (or the comma-list form, e.g. `otlp,console`).

### Changed
- **Depends on `dartastic_opentelemetry_api` 1.0.0-beta.10** and re-exports its surface: the Weaver-generated
  semantic-convention enums (90 registry namespaces incl. entities/metrics/events), `NonRecordingSpan`, and the global
  `TextMapPropagator`. SDK consumers referencing renamed semconv enums through this package inherit the API's breaking
  renames. The complete old→new tables are in the API package's 1.0.0-beta.10 CHANGELOG. SDK span creation is unaffected
  (the API's no-SDK span behavior only applies without an SDK factory installed).
- Examples and tests migrated to the new names (`Db`, `Server`, `Code`,
  `Http.httpRequestMethod`/`httpResponseStatusCode`/`httpResponseBodySize`) and off registry-deprecated keys: the
  database examples now emit `db.system.name`, `db.namespace`, `db.operation.name`, and `db.query.text` instead of the
  deprecated `db.system`/`db.name`/ `db.operation`/`db.statement`, and drop the deprecated `db.user`.
- `CompositePropagator` is constructed via `OTelAPI.compositePropagator` (its constructor is factory-only as of the
  API's beta.10).
- **Default span batch schedule delay changed from 1 s to 5 s** (spec default). The previous hard-coded
  `BatchSpanProcessorConfig(scheduleDelay: Duration(seconds: 1))` in `OTel.initialize()` has been replaced by
  `BatchSpanProcessorConfig.fromEnvironment()`, whose fallback is the spec-mandated 5000 ms. To restore the old
  behavior, set `OTEL_BSP_SCHEDULE_DELAY=1000`.

## [1.1.0-beta.7] - 2026-07-11
### Fixed
- **`OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.export()` gains a Dart-level timeout backstop.** Previously the configured `timeout` was
  applied only via gRPC's `CallOptions` deadline. A Dart-level `.timeout()` now also bounds the RPC and tears down the
  channel on expiry, as defense-in-depth for real-world hangs where a collector accepts a connection then stops
  responding. **Note (under review):** this does NOT fix the concurrency test hang that prompted it. That was event-loop
  starvation from the gRPC client's reconnect churn, which no Timer-based bound can fix (see the PR discussion).
  Reviewers are deciding whether to keep this backstop; if dropped, this entry goes with it.
- **Debug logging no longer adds a `ConsoleExporter` to the trace pipeline.** `OTel.initialize()` used to append a
  `ConsoleExporter` to the span exporters whenever debug logging was enabled (e.g. `OTEL_LOG_LEVEL=debug`/`trace`),
  silently changing the export pipeline shape. Per the OTel spec the default exporter is `otlp` only, the same cleanup
  [#49](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/49) applied to metrics. Console output
  remains available explicitly: `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=console` (replaces the exporter) or the `OTEL_CONSOLE_EXPORTER`
  `--dart-define` (adds one alongside). For span logging use `OTEL_LOG_SPANS=true`.

### Added
- **Configurable exception handling for `Tracer.withSpan` / `withSpanAsync`.** A new `SpanExceptionOptions` (with
  `recordException`, `setStatusOnException`, and an `exceptionSanitizer` callback returning a `SanitizedSpanException`)
  lets callers customize how a thrown exception is recorded and whether the span status is set. The defaults preserve
  the existing behavior (record the exception + set `SpanStatusCode.Error`), and the original exception is always
  rethrown. Configure globally via `OTel.initialize(spanExceptionOptions: ...)` (also available per `TracerProvider` and
  `OTel.addTracerProvider`) and override per call via the new `exceptionOptions:` parameter on `withSpan` /
  `withSpanAsync` / `startActiveSpan` / `startActiveSpanAsync` and `OTel.withSpan` / `OTel.withSpanAsync`. Per-call
  options are merged field-by-field over the global config (via `SpanExceptionOptions.mergeWith`), so overriding a
  single flag preserves a globally configured sanitizer. When a sanitizer is provided, only its returned
  type/message/stacktrace are recorded, the raw exception's details never leak, and if the sanitizer itself throws, the
  span is marked failed with a generic description. This enables SDKs and applications to redact PII before it is
  recorded. ([#51](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/issues/51))

### Fixed
- **API-first usage no longer wedges SDK initialization
  ([#62](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/62)).** The API package auto-installs its
  no-op `OTelAPIFactory` when API-only code runs before the SDK initializes (per the OTel spec). Previously
  `OTel.initialize()` then failed with "can only be initialized once", and `OTel.tracerProvider()` crashed with an
  opaque `APITracerProvider is not a subtype of TracerProvider` cast error. `OTel.initialize()` now replaces exactly the
  auto-installed no-op API factory, identified via `OTelFactory.isAPIFactory` (API ≥ beta.8), so real factories are
  never silently replaced, and the SDK accessors
  (`tracerProvider()`/`meterProvider()`/`loggerProvider()`/`addTracerProvider()`) throw a clear `OTel.initialize() must
  be called first.` `StateError` before initialization instead of the cast error. `OTelSDKFactory` now overrides
  `isAPIFactory` to `false` per the API ≥ beta.8 contract. Note: API objects handed out before `initialize()` remain
  no-ops, capture tracers after initialize. Thanks @robert-northmind for the investigation in
  [#53](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/53) and the regression test suite adapted
  from it.

### Changed
- **Bumped `dartastic_opentelemetry_api` to `^1.0.0-beta.9`.** Beta.8 adds `OTelFactory.isAPIFactory` (used by the fix
  above) and replaces the no-op factory in `OTelAPI.initialize()`; beta.9 fixes pre-initialization lazy no-op installs
  (`tracer()`, `logger()`, `instrumentationScope()`, `TraceState.fromString`, the `fromJson`s) and makes `Context`
  re-read the global factory so an SDK factory installed later actually takes effect.


## [1.1.0-beta.6] - 2026-05-18
- **Bumped `dartastic_opentelemetry_api` to `^1.0.0-beta.7`.** Beta.7 fixes observable metrics and standard env var
  defaults.

### Fixed
- **Default metrics pipeline no longer prints to stdout.** `OTel.initialize()` used to wrap the default OTLP metric
  exporter in a `CompositeMetricExporter` with `ConsoleMetricExporter`, so every server using the SDK with zero env vars
  dumped metric payloads to the console. The default is now OTLP-only, matching traces and logs (and the OTel spec,
  which specifies `otlp` as the default for all three signals. Never `console`). To opt back into stdout output set
  `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=console` (or pass an explicit `metricExporter`/`metricReader` to `OTel.initialize`).

### Added
- **`OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER` / `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER` / `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER` now honored end-to-end.** Each accepts
  `otlp` (default), `console`, or `none`; `none` skips processor/reader installation for that signal entirely.
  Previously only `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER` and `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER` were partially read and `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER` was
  ignored.
- **`OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true` global off-switch.** When set, `OTel.initialize()` installs no span processors, metric
  readers, or log record processors. The SDK becomes a no-op for all three signals. Implemented via the new
  `OTelEnv.isSdkDisabled()` helper.

## [1.1.0-beta.5] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- **`package:dartastic_opentelemetry/testing.dart`**, opt-in library with the in-memory test harness used by the
  dart-otel-reference-demo and every OTel-Dart wrapper. Exports `InMemorySpanExporter` (with `findSpanByName` /
  `findSpansByName` / `findSpansStartingWith` / `clear`), `InMemoryLogExporter`, `InMemoryMetricExporter`,
  `OnDemandMetricReader` (timer-free; tests call `collect()` explicitly via `TestHarness.collectMetrics`), `TestHarness`
  aggregator, and `maybeInitializeOtelForTest()` (singleton initializer for `setUpAll`). Deliberately *not* re-exported
  from the main barrel so production bundles don't carry the test classes, import the `/testing.dart` path explicitly.
  Unifies the test scaffolding across the SDK, the reference demo, and the `otel_*` wrapper packages; previously each
  wrapper had its own near-identical copy.

### Removed
- **Breaking: `Tracer.startSpanWithContext` is removed.** Deprecated since 1.1.0-beta (released 2026-05-07), four betas
  ago. Migration is a 1:1 rename, `tracer.startSpanWithContext(name: x, context: ctx, kind: k, attributes: a)` →
  `tracer.startSpan(x, context: ctx, kind: k, attributes: a)`. To make the returned span active for a scope, wrap the
  work with `tracer.withSpan` (sync) or `tracer.withSpanAsync` (async); the deprecated method had stopped activating the
  span as of 1.1.0-beta anyway, so call sites that relied on activation already needed updating. Test suites that
  exercised `startSpanWithContext` were migrated in this release.

## [1.1.0-beta.4] - 2026-05-11

### Changed
- **Bumped `dartastic_opentelemetry_api` to `^1.0.0-beta.6`.** Beta.6 is a comprehensive OTel semantic-convention
  update, see the API CHANGELOG. Headline-level breaking changes consumers will feel:
  - The `Resource` suffix was dropped from ~60 attribute-key enums (`HttpResource.requestMethod` → `Http.requestMethod`,
    `UrlResource.urlFull` → `Url.urlFull`, etc.). Suffix is kept on six enums that conflict with common Dart / Flutter /
    library types: `ErrorResource`, `ExceptionResource`, `FileResource`, `ProcessResource`, `ServerResource`
    (`package:grpc`), `EventResource` (`package:web`).
  - `UserSemantics` → new `User` enum; `SessionViewSemantics` is split, OTel-spec keys (`session.id`,
    `session.previous_id`) → `Session`, non-spec RUM-style keys → `RumSessionView`.
  - Two new files in the API: `semantic_metrics.dart` (15 enums, ~280 metric instrument names with name + instrument
    kind + unit) and `semantic_events.dart` (16 spec event names). Plus a `semantic_values.dart` with typed value-set
    enums (`DbSystem.postgresql`, `CloudProvider.gcp`, `HttpRequestMethod.get`, etc.).
  - New `OTelAPI.attributesOf<E extends OTelSemantic>(Map<E, Object>)` helper for Dart 3.10 static dot-shorthand.
- **Breaking (web only):** `WebResourceDetector` now emits the user-agent string under `user_agent.original` (the
  current OTel semconv key, via `UserAgent.userAgentOriginal`) instead of `browser.user_agent`. The browser semconv
  namespace removed `browser.user_agent` in favor of the top-level `user_agent.*` registry, see
  https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/registry/attributes/user-agent/. Backends and dashboards that filter on
  the old key will need to update.

## [1.1.0-beta.3] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- **OTLP/HTTP-JSON wire format on all three signals.** `OtlpHttpSpanExporter`, `OtlpHttpMetricExporter`, and
  `OtlpHttpLogRecordExporter` now accept an `OtlpHttpProtocol` config option. Defaults to `httpProtobuf` (unchanged
  behaviour), set to `httpJson` to send proto3-JSON-encoded payloads with `Content-Type: application/json`. The encoding
  follows the OTLP spec's proto3-to-JSON mapping (`request.toProto3Json()` on the generated protobuf classes), so no
  hand-rolled JSON marshaling lives in Dartastic. Wire-up via `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/json` (or
  signal-specific `_TRACES_PROTOCOL` / `_METRICS_PROTOCOL` / `_LOGS_PROTOCOL`) flows through `OTel.initialize`. Per
  spec, `http/json` is `MAY`-support, not `MUST`, adding it lives up to Dartastic's "No skimping: if it's optional in
  the spec, it's included" promise. Unblocks integration with backends that prefer JSON (Genkit dev UI, browser-based
  viewers, lightweight collectors).

## [1.1.0-beta.2] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Pluggable `TimeProvider` for span timestamps.** Web targets (Dart-on-JS, Wasm) automatically get `WebTimeProvider`
  (sub-millisecond via `window.performance.now()` + `timeOrigin`); native targets keep `SystemTimeProvider`
  (`DateTime.now`, unchanged behaviour). No code change required to pick up the web precision, auto-selected via the API
  package's platform-aware `defaultTimeProvider`. Override via `OTel.initialize(timeProvider: customProvider)` for cases
  like a fake clock in tests. The abstraction lives in `dartastic_opentelemetry_api` (see API beta.5 changelog). The
  SDK's `TracerProvider.timeProvider` is now a delegate getter/setter that reads through to the underlying
  `APITracerProvider`, so SDK and API share a single source of truth.
- `OTel.attributesFromSemanticMap(Map<OTelSemantic, Object>)`. Convenience passthrough to
  `OTelAPI.attributesFromSemanticMap`. Lets call sites that build attribute maps from typed semconv enums skip the
  `.key` accessor on every entry: `OTel.attributesFromSemanticMap({HttpResource.requestMethod: 'GET'})` instead of
  `OTel.attributesFromMap({HttpResource.requestMethod.key: 'GET'})`. Mixing different semconv enum types in one map is
  fine. The param type is the `OTelSemantic` interface that every semconv enum implements.

### Changed
- README and every example under `example/` now use `attributesFromSemanticMap` for typed-enum-keyed maps. The longer
  `attributesFromMap` form remains for raw-string-keyed maps (`{'foo.bar': value}`) and shows up in the README only as a
  counter-example for app-specific keys without a typed enum.
- Bumped `dartastic_opentelemetry_api` to `^1.0.0-beta.4`. Beta.4 adds `OTelAPI.loggerProviders()` parallel to the
  existing `tracerProviders()` / `meterProviders()`.

### Fixed
- **Named `LoggerProvider`s now shut down with `OTel.shutdown()`.** Closes the documented gap from beta.1's fix for
  issue [#33](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/issues/33). Beta.1 only shut down the
  default `LoggerProvider`; any provider created via `OTel.addLoggerProvider(name)` still kept its
  `BatchLogRecordProcessor.Timer.periodic` alive, parking the Dart isolate after `main()` returned for any consumer with
  multiple LoggerProviders. With API beta.4's new `loggerProviders()` enumerator, `OTel.shutdown()` now iterates all of
  them the same way it already does for tracer / meter providers.

## [1.1.0-beta.1] - 2026-05-10

### Changed
- Bumped `dartastic_opentelemetry_api` to `^1.0.0-beta.3`. Beta.3 fixes a `ServiceResource` semconv key that was mangled
  by an over-broad find/replace: the entry called `ServiceResource.serviceResourcepace` (with key
  `service.Resourcepace`) is restored to `ServiceResource.serviceNamespace` / `service.namespace`. If you used the
  misspelled name in your own code, replace it with `ServiceResource.serviceNamespace`.

### Fixed
- **`BatchSpanProcessor.shutdown()` no longer drops queued spans.** Two pre-existing bugs in the shutdown path: (1)
  `shutdown()` set `_isShutdown = true` before calling `forceFlush()`, but `forceFlush()` early-returns when
  `_isShutdown == true`, so spans queued at the moment shutdown was invoked were silently dropped. (2) `_exportBatch()`
  only exported up to `maxExportBatchSize` spans and returned, so even when the drain was reached it stopped after one
  batch. Brought in line with `BatchLogRecordProcessor`, which has always drained correctly: `shutdown()` now drains the
  queue *before* setting `_isShutdown`, and both `shutdown()` and `forceFlush()` loop until the queue is empty (or the
  exporter throws, bailing on persistent failure rather than spinning forever).
- **Process exits cleanly after `OTel.shutdown()`
  ([#37](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/37)):** short-lived Dart CLI binaries no
  longer hang after `await OTel.shutdown()` returns. `OTel.shutdown()` was iterating over tracer providers and meter
  providers but not over the default `LoggerProvider`. The default `BatchLogRecordProcessor`'s `Timer.periodic`
  therefore stayed alive after `main()` returned, parking the Dart isolate in `Dart_RunLoop` indefinitely (the symptom
  report described `await OTel.shutdown()` "never returning", but the actual symptom is that *process exit* hangs,
  `print` after `await` does run). `OTel.shutdown()` now also shuts down the default `LoggerProvider`. Named
  LoggerProviders (created via `OTel.addLoggerProvider`) still need to be shut down by the caller. A follow-up will add
  a `loggerProviders()` enumerator to the API so `OTel.shutdown()` can clean them up automatically.
- **Web compatibility:** `package:dartastic_opentelemetry/dartastic_opentelemetry.dart` is now safe to import on web
  targets (Flutter web, `dart compile js`, `dart compile wasm`). Previously the main library transitively pulled in
  `dart:io` via the OTLP/HTTP exporters, certificate utilities, and the platform resource detectors, `dart compile js`
  accepted these imports thanks to Dart 3 stubs, but the moment any of those classes ran (`HttpClient`,
  `SecurityContext`, `Platform.executable`, etc.) you got `UnsupportedError` at runtime. Split into platform-conditional
  facades:
  - `lib/src/resource/native_detectors.dart`, exports `ProcessResourceDetector` and `HostResourceDetector` from
    `_io.dart` on native, from `_stub.dart` on web (stubs throw with a clear migration message if instantiated;
    `PlatformResourceDetector.create()` skips them on web by design).
  - `lib/src/trace/export/otlp/certificate_utils.dart`, `_io.dart` keeps `validateCertificates` +
    `createSecurityContext`; `_stub.dart` keeps only `validateCertificates`. The IO-only `createSecurityContext` is
    reachable via the IO HTTP exporter path. gRPC exporters import `certificate_utils_io.dart` directly (gRPC is IO-only
    by nature).
  - `lib/src/trace/export/otlp/http/http_client_factory.dart`. New helper that returns `IOClient(HttpClient(...))` on
    native and `BrowserClient` on web. The three OTLP HTTP exporters (`OtlpHttpSpanExporter` / `OtlpHttpMetricExporter`
    / `OtlpHttpLogRecordExporter`) lost their direct `dart:io` imports and now delegate `_createHttpClient()` to this
    factory.

  Net effect on web: tracer/metrics/logs API works, OTLP/HTTP exporters work via the browser's fetch (browser owns TLS.
  Custom CA / mTLS settings are ignored with a warning), `PlatformResourceDetector.create()` returns the env-var + web
  detector composite. `OtlpGrpcSpanExporter` and friends remain native-only, gRPC over HTTP/2 trailers isn't a thing in
  browsers regardless of dart:io.

  New regression test: `test/web/web_compile_smoke_test.dart` runs in Chrome, imports the main library, initializes the
  SDK, constructs all three HTTP exporters, and runs the platform resource detector.
- **dart2wasm:** `tool/web_tests.sh` (and CI) now runs the web suite under both dart2js (default) and dart2wasm. Caught
  and fixed a JS-interop bug in `gzip_web.dart`. The `ReadableStream` reader yielded a `JSUint8Array` that was being
  cast directly to `Uint8List`, which works on dart2js but fails with `TypeError: 'JSValue' is not a subtype of type
  'Uint8List'` on dart2wasm. Now goes through `JSUint8Array.toDart` so it works on both compilers.

## [1.1.0-beta] - 2026-05-07

### Changed
- Bumped `dartastic_opentelemetry_api` to `^1.0.0-beta.2` (Zone-based context propagation, contributed to the API by
  Kevin Moore [@kevmoo](https://github.com/kevmoo); the cross-isolate `isRemote` fix in beta.1; new
  `DatabaseResource.dbCollectionName`, `DatabaseResource.dbResponseReturnedRows`, and `UserSemantics.userRoles` semconv
  enums in beta.2; and the breaking removal of the singular `UserSemantics.userRole` in beta.2).
- **Breaking:** `Tracer.withSpan` and `Tracer.withSpanAsync` now propagate context via Zones (`Context.runSync` /
  `Context.run`) instead of mutating the static `Context.current`. Async callbacks within a spanned scope now correctly
  observe the active span across `await` boundaries; concurrent `withSpanAsync` calls no longer race on the global
  static.
- **Breaking:** `Tracer.startSpan` no longer auto-activates the returned span (matching the new API contract and the
  OpenTelemetry specification). Use `OTel.withSpan` / `OTel.withSpanAsync` (or the equivalent on `Tracer`, or the
  `startActiveSpan` / `startActiveSpanAsync` convenience methods) to make a span active for a scope.
- **Breaking:** removed `Tracer.recordSpan` and `Tracer.recordSpanAsync`. They were redundant with
  `startActiveSpan`/`Async` (which expose the span to `fn`) and the name was unclear ("record what?"). Migration: a
  one-liner `tracer.recordSpan(name: x, fn: f)` becomes `OTel.tracer().startActiveSpan(name: x, fn: (_) => f())`. For
  the explicit lifecycle, use `tracer.startSpan(...)` + `OTel.withSpan(span, fn)` + `try/catch/finally` with
  `span.end()` in `finally`.
- Added `OTel.withSpan(span, fn)` and `OTel.withSpanAsync(span, fn)` static convenience methods that delegate to the
  default tracer, saves callers from threading a `Tracer` reference for the common activation case. Both accept
  `APISpan` (matching the API contract for cross-implementation interop).
- **Breaking:** renamed the SDK `Logger` class to `OTelLogger` to avoid clashing with `package:logging`'s `Logger`.
  Migration: replace `Logger` (the SDK type) with `OTelLogger` in your code. `OTel.logger(...)` and
  `OTel.loggerProvider().getLogger(...)` continue to return the same instances, only the type name changed.
  `LoggerProvider`, `APILogger`, and other `Logger*`-prefixed symbols are unchanged.
- **Breaking:** `Tracer.startSpanWithContext` no longer mutates `Context.current`. It is now a thin wrapper around
  `startSpan(name, context: ctx)` and is `@Deprecated`. Activate the returned span explicitly with `Tracer.withSpan` /
  `withSpanAsync`.
- `Tracer.startSpan`: when both `context` and `parentSpan` are provided with different traces, the explicit `parentSpan`
  now wins for `traceId` and `traceFlags` resolution. Previously the SDK would build an internally inconsistent
  SpanContext (context's traceId + parentSpan's spanId) which the new API validation correctly rejects.
- `Tracer.startSpan`: replaced the stale `effectiveContext != Context.root` identity-style check with a content-based
  check (`effectiveContext.span != null` + always read `effectiveContext.spanContext`). The old check skipped parent
  inheritance whenever `Context.current == Context.root`, which is the case inside an isolate spawned via
  `Context.runIsolate()` (the API attaches the propagated context as both the isolate's current and root). Combined with
  the API beta.1 `isRemote` fix, trace continuity now works end-to-end across `runIsolate`.

### Added
- `OTel.contextKey<T>(name)` now accepts an optional `isTransferable` flag (default `false`) which is forwarded to the
  API. Custom context keys must opt in to cross-isolate transfer; built-in `Baggage` and `SpanContext` always transfer.
- Re-exported `ServerResource` and `UrlResource` semantic enums from the API.
- New regression test (`tracer_methods_test.dart`) verifying that concurrent `withSpanAsync` operations isolate their
  active span. Would catch any future regression of the Zone migration.

### Fixed
- `test/web/util/zip/gzip_web_test.dart`: replaced a corrupt hardcoded base64 gzip blob (CRC mismatch, the browser's
  `DecompressionStream`, Python's `gzip`, and Node all reject it) with a freshly-generated one (`mtime=0` for a
  deterministic header). Pre-existing bug; the test had never passed under a strict gzip decoder.
- Tooling: `Makefile` `test-safe` and `test-web` targets pointed at `tool/run_tests.sh` and `tool/web_tests.sh`, neither
  of which existed. Repointed `test-safe` at the existing `tool/test.sh` (used by CI). Added `tool/web_tests.sh` running
  `dart test -p chrome ./test/web`.
- CI: added a `test-web` job to `.github/workflows/dart.yml` that runs `tool/web_tests.sh` in Chrome on every push and
  PR, web tests previously only ran locally on demand.
- Documentation: every example file (and every code snippet in the SDK and API READMEs) now uses typed enum keys for
  span/log/baggage attributes, never raw strings. Examples without a matching OTel-semconv enum define a small local
  `ExampleAttribute` / `ExampleBaggage` / `DemoAttribute` enum at the top of the file to demonstrate the recommended
  pattern (the placeholder name is `ExampleAttribute`/`ExampleBaggage` rather than `AppAttribute` so readers rename it
  for their domain instead of copying it verbatim; the redundant `app.` prefix was also dropped from invented demo
  keys). Replaces deprecated `net.peer.*`, `client.ip`, `http.url`, `http.response_content_length` with their modern
  semconv equivalents (`ServerResource.serverAddress/Port`, `ClientResource.clientAddress`, `UrlResource.urlFull`,
  `HttpResource.responseBodySize`).
- Examples updated for spec-aligned behavior:
  - `example.dart`, `grafana_cloud_env_example.dart`, `grafana/grafana_cloud_env_example.dart`: replaced `'url.full'` /
    `'url.path'` / `'net.peer.name'` / `'net.peer.port'` string literals with the new `UrlResource` and `ServerResource`
    enums.
  - `isolate_context_example.dart`: rewritten to use `tracer.withSpanAsync` so the parent SpanContext propagates into
    `runIsolate`, and to avoid capturing non-sendable SDK objects in the isolate closure. Also dropped a private `src/`
    import.
  - `propagator_example.dart`: built the inject Context from `span.spanContext` directly instead of relying on the
    deprecated auto-activation; Step 5 now reports the child span's own ids (and parent linkage) rather than the active
    context's.

## [1.0.2-alpha] - 2026-04-19
### Fixed
- Fixed `OTel.defaultEndpoint` to use the OTLP/HTTP port `4318` instead of the gRPC port `4317`, matching the default
  `http/protobuf` protocol per the OpenTelemetry specification
  ([#29](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/issues/29)). Removed the conditional port-swap
  workarounds in trace and logs configuration.
- Fixed `SimpleLogRecordProcessor.shutdown()` not flushing pending exports
  ([#28](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/28)).
- Fixed flaky `OtlpGrpcLogRecordExporter endpoint empty host defaults to 127.0.0.1` test that depended on no process
  listening on port 4317.

### Changed
- `MetricsConfiguration` now defaults to the HTTP/protobuf protocol (consistent with the trace and logs pipelines and
  with the OpenTelemetry specification). Set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc` (or
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_PROTOCOL=grpc`) to opt back into gRPC.

### Added
- Public `exporter` getter on `PeriodicExportingMetricReader` and `exporters` getter on `CompositeMetricExporter` for
  introspection and testability.

## [1.0.1-alpha] - 2026-04-05
- Added a BaggageSpanProcessor that adds Baggage as SpanAttributes

### Added
- Log Signal SDK implementation
- Upgraded to dartastic_opentelemetry_api: ^1.0.0-alpha with Log Signal API

## The 0.9.x stable channel

`0.9.4` and up are not a separate line of development. Each one is the current `1.1.0-beta.x` code republished under a
`0.9.x` version so that users who have not opted into prereleases still get the fixes before the v1 release. The code is
identical to the beta it names; only the version stamp and the `dartastic_opentelemetry_api` constraint differ. Prefer
the `1.1.0-beta.x` line if your pubspec allows prereleases. It is what these entries point at.

## [0.9.8] - 2026-08-13
Stable-channel republication of `1.1.0-beta.13`. Depends on `dartastic_opentelemetry_api: ^0.9.1`.

This release also carries the `1.1.0-beta.12` changes, which never reached this channel: the `host.arch` fix
([#91](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/91)), registry-enum attribute keys throughout,
and the removal of the non-registry `host.processors`, `host.locale`, and `process.num_threads` resource attributes.
Read the `1.1.0-beta.12` entry as well before upgrading from 0.9.7.

### Security

- **Fixes the OTLP debug-log credential leak,
  [GHSA-4rh6-c2v5-374w](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/security/advisories/GHSA-4rh6-c2v5-374w)
  (CWE-532).** Every `0.9.x` release from `0.9.0` through `0.9.7` is affected: with debug logging enabled, OTLP header
  values, including `Authorization`, `api-key`, and whatever name your backend uses. Were written to the log. This is
  the first release on the stable channel that redacts them. See the `1.1.0-beta.13` entry above for the mechanism and
  for the `OTEL_DART_HEADER_LOG_ALLOWLIST` opt-in.

  **If you ran any 0.9.x release with debug logging enabled and a credential in an OTLP header, rotate that
  credential.** Upgrading alone does not undo the exposure.

## [0.9.7] - 2026-07-20
Stable-channel republication of `1.1.0-beta.11`. Docs only over 0.9.6. Depends on `dartastic_opentelemetry_api: ^0.9.1`.

Adds the `1.1.0-beta.10` fixes over 0.9.6: baggage extraction preserving context and endpoint scheme determining TLS
([#89](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/89)), OTLP/JSON enum fields encoded as
integers per spec ([#86](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/86)), and public
`MetricTransformer.transformMetrics` ([#85](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/85)).

## [0.9.6] - 2026-07-18
Stable-channel republication of `1.1.0-beta.9`. Depends on `dartastic_opentelemetry_api: ^0.9.1`, itself the
republication of api `1.0.0-rc.1`, note the api constraint moved off the `1.0.0-beta.x` range that 0.9.5 used.

Covers everything from `1.1.0-beta.1` through `1.1.0-beta.9`; see those entries for the detail. Highlights for anyone
coming from 0.9.5: `OTEL_PROPAGATORS` support
([api#55](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry_api/pull/55),
[#76](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/76)), BatchSpanProcessor environment variables
([#59](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/59)), comma-separated `OTEL_*_EXPORTER` lists
([#79](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/79)), OTLP/HTTP-JSON wire format
([#45](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/45)), OTLP/JSON trace and span ids encoded as
hex per spec ([#60](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/60)), `LoggerProvider` shutdown
fixes ([#37](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/37),
[#41](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/41)), web/wasm safety
([#36](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/36)), and the removal of the non-standard
`dartasticApiKey` and `tenantId` ([#78](https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/dartastic_opentelemetry/pull/78)).

## [0.9.5] - 2026-05-09
Stable-channel republication of `1.1.0-beta`, the first of these. Depends on `dartastic_opentelemetry_api:
^1.0.0-beta.2`. Covers `1.0.0-alpha` through `1.1.0-beta` for users still on 0.9.3, most notably the Log signal SDK.

`0.9.4` was stamped in git a minute before 0.9.5 with the same code but never published to pub.dev; there is no 0.9.4
release.
